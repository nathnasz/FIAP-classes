                <p> Hey! My name is Nathalia Nasz, and I am an 18-year-old who has been working in marketing since 2020. Since then, I have been deepening myself in Marketing Strategies and Business, among other areas that compose digital commerce. On that note, I am on the last module of my Commerce Course, allowing me to have a broader vision of the current market and its innovations.
